Unclaimed monies relating to unredeemed pledges auctioned on or before 24 October 2015
---
Where a pledge pawned for any sum exceeding $50 is sold for more than the reserve price, being the amount of the loan and interest due, the pawnbroker shall, within 10 days after the sale, inform the pawner by registered post of the amount of surplus realised at the sale.

If no demand for the surplus is made within 4 months after the sale, the pawnbroker shall pay the surplus to the Accountant-General within 14 days after the expiration of the period of 4 months.

All unclaimed monies paid to the Accountant-General are transferred to the Consolidated Fund after 6 years unless a claim is made. A claimant may, at any time, make an application for the monies even after they are paid into the Consolidated Fund.
