<h2>Unclaimed monies relating to unredeemed pledges auctioned on or before 24 October 2015</h2>
<p>Where a pledge pawned for any sum exceeding $50 is sold for more than
the reserve price, being the amount of the loan and interest due, the pawnbroker
shall, within 10 days after the sale, inform the pawner by registered post
of the amount of surplus realised at the sale.</p>
<p>If no demand for the surplus is made within 4 months after the sale, the
pawnbroker shall pay the surplus to the Accountant-General within 14 days
after the expiration of the period of 4 months.</p>
<p>All unclaimed monies paid to the Accountant-General are transferred to
the Consolidated Fund after 6 years unless a claim is made. A claimant
may, at any time, make an application for the monies even after they are
paid into the Consolidated Fund.</p>
