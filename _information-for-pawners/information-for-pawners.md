**1. When are the pawnbrokers’ auctions?**<br>
With the enactment of the Pawnbrokers Act 2015 on 1 April 2015, pledges taken in by pawnbrokers from 1 April 2015 onwards that remain unredeemed on the expiry of the lawful redemption period will be forfeited instead of auctioned. In the event of such a forfeiture, the unredeemed pledges becomes the absolute property of the pawnbroker. The last public auction of pawnbrokers' unredeemed pledges was held on 24 October 2015. 

**2. How do I know if I have unclaimed surplus due to me pursuant to the repealed Pawnbrokers Act, and how do I get the surplus back?**<br>
Please refer to following Registry of Pawnbrokers web-link on how you can check if there are any [unclaimed monies](/information-for-pawners/unclaimed-monies/){:target="_blank"} due to you and the steps to recover them.

**3. Modes of service for Notice of Forfeiture and fee for the issuance of each pawn ticket**<br>
With effect from 1 January 2023, Pawnbrokers are permitted to impose a fee of $2 for each pawn ticket issued and to send the Notice of Forfeiture to pawners via the following additional manners: <br><br>
(a) In person; <br><br>
(b) SMS to the telephone number of the pawner stated on the pawn ticket; or <br><br>
(c) Provided the pawner consents in writing, by electronic communication using internet-based service. For instance, via WhatsApp or the pawnbroker’s own website / mobile application, if the website or application has a mechanism for the pawner to receive electronic communications through the pawner’s account. <br>
