**1. When are the pawnbrokersâ€™ auctions?**<br>
With the enactment of the Pawnbrokers Act 2015 on 1 April 2015, pledges taken in by pawnbrokers from 1 April 2015 onwards that remain unredeemed on the expiry of the lawful redemption period will be forfeited instead of auctioned. In the event of such a forfeiture, the unredeemed pledges becomes the absolute property of the pawnbroker.<br>
The last public auction of pawnbrokers' unredeemed pledges was held on 24 October 2015. 

**2. How do I know if there is any surplus due to me from the items pawned before 1 April 2015 and how do I get the surplus back?**<br>
