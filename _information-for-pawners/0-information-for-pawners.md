Information for Pawners
---
**1. When are the pawnbrokersâ€™ auctions?**<br>
With the enactment of the Pawnbrokers Act 2015 on 1 April 2015, pledges taken in by pawnbrokers from 1 April 2015 onwards that remain unredeemed on the expiry of the lawful redemption period will be forfeited instead of auctioned. In the event of such a forfeiture, the unredeemed pledges becomes the absolute property of the pawnbroker. The last public auction of pawnbrokers' unredeemed pledges was held on 24 October 2015. 

**2. How do I know if I have unclaimed surplus due to me pursuant to the repealed Pawnbrokers Act, and how do I get the surplus back?**<br>
Please refer to following Registry of Pawnbrokers web-link on how you can check if there are any [unclaimed monies](/information-for-pawners/unclaimed-monies/){:target="_blank"} due to you and the steps to recover them.
